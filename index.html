                <p>
                    It is far too difficult to find parking spots in a city because of the density of the population. We want to find a way to let people know where there are open spots and how much those spots may cost.

                    My group and I worked together to solve problems about parking spots
                    It is far too difficult to find parking spots in a city because of the density of the population. We want to find a way to let people know where there are open spots and how much those spots may cost.
